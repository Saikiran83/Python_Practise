""" Class Methods:
Inside method implementation if we are using only class variables (static variables), 
then such type of methods we should declare as class method.
We can declare class method explicitly by using @classmethod decorator. 
For class method we should provide cls variable at the time of declaration
We can call classmethod by using classname or object reference variable.
