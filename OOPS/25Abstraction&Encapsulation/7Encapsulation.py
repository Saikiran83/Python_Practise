# Encapsulation in Python describes the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit. So, for example, when you create a class, it means you are implementing encapsulation. A class is an example of encapsulation as it binds all the data members (instance variables) and methods into a single unit.
# Using encapsulation, we can hide an objectâ€™s internal representation from the outside. This is called information hiding.
# Also, encapsulation allows us to restrict accessing variables and methods directly and prevent accidental data modification by creating private data members and methods within a class.

# Encapsulation is a way to can restrict access to methods and variables from outside of class. Whenever we are working with the class and dealing with sensitive data, providing access to all variables used within the class is not a good choice.

# Encapsulation is one of the cornerstone concepts of OOP. The basic idea of Encapsulation is to wrap up both data and methods into one single unit. The way that data and methods are organized does not matter to the end-user. The user is only concerned about the right way to provide input and expects a correct output on the basis of the inputs provided.

# Encapsulation in Python also ensures that objects are self-sufficient functioning pieces and can work independently.
