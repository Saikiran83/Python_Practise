# The abstract classes may also contain concrete methods that have the implementation of the method and can be used by all the concrete classes. To define a concrete method in an abstract class, we simply define a method with implementation and donâ€™t decorate it with the @abstractmethod decorator. If needed, we may also override this concrete method in the concrete class to provide any additional functionality as per user needs.
